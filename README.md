## Unified Zero-Inflated Hurdle Regression Models
Run a Gibbs sampler for hurdle models to analyze data showing an excess of zeros, which is common in zero-inflated count and semi-continuous models. The package includes the hurdle model under Gaussian, gamma, inverse Gaussian, Weibull, exponential, Beta, Poisson, negative binomial, logarithmic, Bell, generalized Poisson, and binomial distributional assumptions.
